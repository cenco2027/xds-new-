      <p class="block-description">
        At XDS, we've spent three decades refining how bicycles are built by controlling every step of the process, from carbon layup to final torque check. While many brands rely on third parties, we've kept production under one roof to ensure consistency and quality at every stage.<br><br>
        This approach allows us to fine-tune geometry, optimize materials, and deliver bikes that perform across categories and price points. It's how we bring together performance, value, and scale in a way that works for both riders and retailers.
