                    At XDS, vertical integration isn't a buzzword — it's how we deliver consistency and performance at scale. We control the entire manufacturing process: from aerospace-grade carbon fiber and robotic welding to final paint and inspection.<br><br>
                    While most brands outsource their frames, we mold, cure, align, and test in-house, starting from raw carbon, aluminum, or magnesium stock.<br><br>
                    The result? Tighter tolerances, fewer issues, and real confidence for riders and shops.
