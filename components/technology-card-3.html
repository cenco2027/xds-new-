                    XDS has built bikes that have crossed finish lines across Europe, North America, and Asia. From Olympic MTB frames to pro tour road bikes, our designs are trusted by national teams, including the XDS Astana Team.<br><br>
                    Now, we're building a future where independent dealers don't have to choose between performance and partnership.<br><br>
                    The tech is proven. The infrastructure is in place. The next generation of high-performance bikes is here.
